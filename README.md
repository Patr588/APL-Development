TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN
CAMEROON
Introduction:
Traffic congestion is a growing problem across the world particularly in
densely populated urban areas. It cause by a combination of factors such as
population growth , increased in car ownership ,inadequate public
transportation infrastructure and the rise of e-commerce and delivery
services which have led to a surge in the number of vehicles on the roadObjectives.

The objectives of traffic congestion is to reduce the efficiency and accessibility of transportation
system using real- time data analytics technology , artificial intelligence an other innovative solutions
to optimize traffic routing , signal timing and transportation infrastructure. Move over the power of
technology it is possible to create intelligent transportation systems that can help adjust to changing
traffic conditions.

▪ Rapid urbanization: Cameroon’s population has been growing rapidly, particularly in cities like Buea , Douala ,
Yaounde leading to increased demand for transportation and congestion on the roads.
▪ Road safety regulations: inadequate road safety regulations and enforcement can contribute to traffic of road
accidents and reducing the efficiency of the transportation system.
▪ Informal transportation services: informal transportation services such as taxi and minivans are widely used in
Cameroon and can contribute to traffic congestion mostly common is big cities and town.
▪ Inadequate road infrastructure: many urban areas in Cameroon have inadequate road infrastructure including
poorly maintained roads and limited capacity for public transportation which contribute to traffic congestion.
▪ Increased in car ownership: As the middle class in Cameroon has grown, there has been an increase in cars
ownership leading to more vehicles on the road.
▪ Limited public transportation options :Many urban areas in Cameroon have limited and unreliable public
transportation systems forcing residents to rely on private vehicles or informal transportation services which
can contribute to traffic congestion.
Addressing traffic congestion in Cameroon will require a combination of measures including investing in public
transportation infrastructure , implementing intelligent transportation system that use real-time data analytics and
AI to optimize traffic rounting and signal timing promoting alternative modes of transportation such as cycling and
walking.
